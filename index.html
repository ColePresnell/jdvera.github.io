					My name is James Vera.  I’ve lived most of my life in the Austin area.  I grew up in Kyle, and now live in northern Austin.  The city is awesome, but Texas is always so hot during most of the year.  If I ever moved, I would likely move north, out of Texas.
					<br><br>
					I went to college at Texas A&amp;M University.  My dad also went to A&amp;M, and my brother went to UT.  While I love A&amp;M and enjoy the rivalry between the schools, I’ve never really had that “hatred” toward UT like some people have towards rival schools.
					<br><br>
					I previously worked for a SaaS company, doing tier-1 technical support.  From that and some of the intro programming classes I took in college, I feel I developed a solid foundation regarding programming concepts and the importance of appearance/syntax.  However, since I do not have any more formal education in programming, I could not move into the positions I was more interested in, which is why I’m attending this class.
					<br><br>
					In my free time, I mostly just watch YouTube.  I do like video games, but I don’t really care for the popular RTS/FPS online games.  I have good strategy, but not great reaction time.  I also really enjoy playing Magic: the Gathering, which can be a very complicated game.  My brother and many of our friends also play Magic, and are software engineers/developers.  They’ve said that me being good at Magic should help me do well in this field too, so I guess we’ll see.
